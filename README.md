# Why Formal Information Security Management Is Required?

**Why is it a problem?**

• Dfferent threats leading to large and varied array of technology and vendors.

• Many times the technical response is reactive and not planned, e.g., breached.

• Overall effectiveness of the security measures can be difficult to determine.

• The focus is increasingly on people as the weak point not the technology.

• Good security tends to be an opinion rather than a supportable fact.

**What Are The Implications?**

• Increased cost due to multiple technical controls and/or duplication.

• Increased complexity to manage an ever increasing technology base.

• Susceptible to new threats, delayed remediations of vulnerabilities.

• Cyber Security can get in the way by blocking business processes.

• Incident resolution and maintenance of cyber systems is challenging.

• It is easy to loose sight of the big picture by focusing on issues.

# What Do Need To Effectively Nanage Information Security Risk?

1. Corporate decisions on how risk must be managed (strategy, principles,
policies, standards etc.);

2. Knowing how much risk the organization is willing to accept (risk
tolerance/appetite);

3. An understanding of who accepts risk on behalf of the organization
(understanding and adherence);

4. A method or process to understand the risk and how to deal with it (risk
assessments, risk treatment);

5. Knowing what needs to be protected (inventory, information classification);

6. A method to effectively communicate responsibilities and obligations
(escalate risks and decisions);

7. A comprehensive and balanced set of requirements;

8. A method and process for managing everyone’s expectations (sign off);
and

9. A common framework to put it all together.

Information security needs to be a continuously operating management system
