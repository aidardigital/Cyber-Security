# Why Formal Information Security Management Is Required?

Why is it a problem?
• Dfferent threats leading to large and varied array of technology and vendors.
• Many times the technical response is reactive and not planned, e.g., breached.
• Overall effectiveness of the security measures can be difficult to determine.
• The focus is increasingly on people as the weak point not the technology.
• Good security tends to be an opinion rather than a supportable fact.

Implications
• Increased cost due to multiple technical controls and/or duplication.
• Increased complexity to manage an ever increasing technology base.
• Susceptible to new threats, delayed remediations of vulnerabilities.
• Cyber Security can get in the way by blocking business processes.
• Incident resolution and maintenance of cyber systems is challenging.
• It is easy to loose sight of the big picture by focusing on issues.
