# What is a COSO framework?

The COSO framework classifies internal control objectives into three groups: operations, information, and compliance. Operational objectives include performance measures and safeguarding the organization's assets against fraud. They focus on the effectiveness and efficiency of business transactions.

The COSO Framework is a system used to establish internal controls to be integrated into business processes. Collectively, these controls provide reasonable assurance that the organization is operating ethically, transparently and in accordance with established industry standards.

# What is the difference between COSO and COBIT?

Both COSO and COBIT were designed to be frameworks for internal controls, but COSO focuses on fiduciary duty and financial risk reporting more broadly and COBIT is focused on the structure and security of the IT system.
